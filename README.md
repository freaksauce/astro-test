# Markdown frontmatter undefined on build

When I run `npm run dev` everything is fine, however when I run `npm run build` I get the error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')
```

I have recreated my application with this very stripped down and simple version and still have the same build error.
